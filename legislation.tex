\chapter{Legislative basics}

\begin{enumerate}[ยง 1]
  \item This legislation applies to all employees of Clearhaus {\small A/S} and
    any subsidiary companies in Denmark, as well as abroad.

  \item The term \emph{Cake} as used in this document may be
    interpreted in a literal sense --- i.e.\ cake --- as well as pastry, ice
    cream et.\ al.
    
  \item Individuals having undergone/undergoing any described circumstance are 
    referred to as \emph{cake offering responsible} (\emph{COR}).

  \item Foodstuff not containing an appropriate amount of sugar or with an
    unacceptably low amount of calories, may not be interpreted as
    \emph{cake}.

    Upon the judgement that \emph{cake} is not an acceptable term for the
    offering, \emph{COR} will be obligated to procure proper \emph{cake}.

  \item \Cref{chp:circumstances} describes circumstances in which a traditional
    offering of \emph{cake} is expected by the \emph{COR}.   Notice that \textbf{ยง12} is an exception.
